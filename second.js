Comparision operator


=  >>>>assignment  -when you assign value tothe variable we use =
== >>>>>compare the data 
===actual comparision , data and dataype

var a= 10
undefined
var a = "10"
undefined
var b = "10"
undefined
a==b
true
a===b
true
c = 10
10
a ===c
false
var d = true

console.log---- it used to check debug and output

what value is coming Headers--do i hae value for this or not we can debug

alert("Form submitted")

Calculator

var a = prompt("Enter first number")
var b = prompt("Enter second number")
alert(a+b)


var a = prompt("Enter first number")
var b = prompt("Enter second number")
alert(a+b)
undefined
var a ="10"
undefined
parseInt(a)
10
var a = "hi"
undefined
parseInt(a)
NaN
var a = "10.88"
undefined
parseInt(a)
10
parseFloat(a)
10.88


var a ="10"
undefined
Number(a)
10
var b ="10.88"
undefined
parseFloat(b)
10.88
parseInt(a)
10

Number is new way of converting  string numeric to pure numberic
//rember if you are taking anythinng from url, fro input box or prompt ..it is string and you have to convert it

alert(Number(a)+Number(b)) 


>>html , CSS is static thing..u cannot debug only JS code can debug is a static file

********************\
till this point/ topic conecept WritableStream..ther is no other way
later all are application oriented but u cannot expect full blown in javascript application 
here in small concepts you build the logics and here in framework u impleemnt the logic
not fullfledge application here we are not making..these are small small apps

serverside only can talk to db...these are client side and here iam going to call api and then can get current webkitConvertPointFromNodeToPage...and curretn weather

Thype script is also same like Ecma script but u have to mention the datatype specifcally

you need to write some functions and inside u can write this code and actuaaly u have to invoke that directly cannot use it..there is invocation
