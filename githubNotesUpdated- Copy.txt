Github is very important in the developer life

why so

All the people share their code through git

Suppose i am working on one project i have to make one Repo bythe name of that project, over that Repo i have to push that code

when you follow..by default you will get notifcation for every push

if you make public everyone can use it , if you make it private only you can use it

one repo got created

it givesme this type cpmmands

/////Github
echo "# javascript" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/subbarao123j/javascript.git
git push -u origin master

/////


if you are using winows uneed to download one thing called gitbash

in mac you have terminal that can talk to git

but widnow you have to instaall git bash..after isntall

suppose you have one folder where you want to push the code..going that folder and right click git bash here, it will open one terminal 

i will say for very first time for one repositery

{{ first time for particular repo}}

git init     /// to initialize the git--initilaise the git in that folder --check one hidden folder .git generated 
git add .   /// add everythiing..it add all the files 
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/subbarao123j/javascript.git//// what remote will do remote will connect to your local folder //where you want to link//take that link after //you ahve to conne with onlinee git repositey created one link is generated automatically and copy and rightclick and paste ///how my local sytem know that push into this repo 
git push -u origin master  ////wait for that termail after push for confirmation 


{next every time for particular repo } you will take only three commands

git add .   /// add everythiing
git commit -m "first commit"
git push -u origin master     //first time only orign master needed

--Branches and all will take it in upcoming sessions 

///
add or remove anything 

only

 git add .

git commit -m "second commit"

git push

if you want to add or delete --jsut push
else if anyone has changed anyof the file then first pull and then push

to ge the updated code on the repo and then push ..

u cannot push into my repo ..u ahve to make ur own repo and push //to push into others repo then they needto add your useraccount to push u permisions need to give

Regarfing braches--insted of master we use our branch name later, if branch is diffeent


git remote -v  //in our local repositery can w e see our directloy connected with this repo..it will tell you where it is linked 


one repo for one remote

i have given one address and it should goto that one address only --how can i go two address at one time


if you ever login into your system into github..then while pushing it will ask we have to give  othewise you have alreay login then it will proceed

=============

From local to repo direct push //no need to pulll

aswell no need to remote again and -u origa master

direct git add .
commit 
push commands

===============

tomorrow develoepr added file to my repo in github and i also have new file then push it will erro so pull first and then push comand

=================
Sumamry

Termonnoligy understnding..repo, remote, locally....adding..comming..pushing ..pulling..

1st time

git init
git add  .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/subbarao123j/javascript.git
git push -u origin master

Next time, if only push scenario(added locally one file )


git add .
git commit -m "first commit"

git push 



Only Pull scenario (t repo some one has added one file to same repo)

git add .
git commit -m "first commit"

git pull


there is pulle and push scerios (added locally one file and at repo some one has added one file to same repo)

git add .
git commit -m "first commit"

git pull
git push

---------
branching later above scenario same branch 
Queries asked and ansered

1) to see which repositery it is connected
git remote -v
git remote -v  //in our local repositery can w e see our directloy connected with this repo..it will tell you where it is linked 

2) u cannot push into my repo ..u ahve to make ur own repo and push //to push into others repo then they needto add your useraccount to push u permisions need to give
3) one repo for one remote

i have given one address and it should goto that one address only --how can i go two address at one time

4) f you ever login into your system into github..then while pushing it will ask we have to give  othewise you have alreay login then it will proceed
5) Regarfing braches--insted of master we use our branch name later, if branch is diffeent
