version
There is no version in java script it doesnot work in that way
It works based on java script versions are defined by your

>Es> Ecma Script 
javascript
TypeScript...both are on based  on Ecma script

Es5>old
Es6>new new also got 7 and 8

you can use together both , 
every open version they are adding not removing

we can have one file half coding in Es5 and half coding Es6 also

dataType -- We need to learn what are the datatypes it support

> String "adb" 'sdd' "454" '553'  'true' "false" --anything in quotes
>Number  any numberic value ..47,66666564, 44.555, 5
>Boolean  true/false  // when we try some logic i will show you ther u ca us e0 as false

null  //identfier
undefined

//Es5////
//variable means you need space where u can save som data

var a = "hi"   
var b = 10
var c= true

//var is single key word u can declare any variable
//initial days in the comand promt or browser ..later i will show in file
//Type os is is inbuilt method in java script

//in short i can say that there are one var able ES6..right now var will telly u which kind of variable 

//we can define the varabile by definding some values to it...example typeof is built i n MSInputMethodContext.apply..

var a = 10
 var b = 5

 var a = 10
 var b = 5
undefined
a+b
15
a-b
5
a*b
50
a/b

2


a%b means modules or reminder

10%5
0
4%3
1
4%2
0

2%4
3%4


//keep checking keep talking and keep understanding

modules of smaller to larger its always smaller 

var a= "hi "

var b = "Javascript"


this notes will help u alot

it we use + with number they wil add

if we use + with string they will concat

Nan --stands for not a number

In short with + only string works nothing else  

String +string = String 
String +number = string
number +string = string
number+number = number

"10"+10+"10"
"1010"
101010

10+10+"10"
2010

"10"+10+10
101010

//////
"10"+10+"10"-1
101009

10+10+"10"-1
2009

"10"+10+10-1
101009


accoording to the logic u guys are correct

very imp only 1% can answer this
my focus is to train on javascript
react, angular, node or anyone ..first javascript and then 30% framework

how we got this answer i wil explain tomorrow

tavascript is an interpreted language , not a compiled language..basically it runs line by line later on it compiels all ..each line got executes 

First abt abobe answer  how boolean behaves multiple consoles and prompt.apply confrim and alert 

I am not about days and i am about content 

make a habit of revisoion 
come to this link and....see the code what we written
